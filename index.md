## üë©üèº‚Äçüíª  ML projects

**Semi-supervised machine learning techniques for infant motility classification (January - September,2021)**
‚Ä¢ This novel academic research funded by BABA project was a collaboration with Helsinki University and was the focus of my MS thesis. 
‚Ä¢ The thesis predominantly applied unsupervised algorithms such as autoencoder(AE) and contrastive predictive coding (CPC) for representation learning and further used supervised learning algorithm on the learned representation to perform infant motility classification.
‚Ä¢ The optimal semi-supervised model identified by fine-tuning the hyper-parameters based on the unweighted average F1-Score (UWAF) metric improved classification in comparison to end-to-end supervised models, especially for lower amounts of available annotated data. 
‚Ä¢ Supervised by Dr. Manu Airaksinen, and Prof. Sampsa Vanhatalo, Helsinki University, Finland.
‚Ä¢ Role: Technical ML developer 
‚Ä¢ **_Technology used:_** TensorFlow 2.2, Python, MATLAB, Git.

**MIMO channel estimation using Deep Image Prior (DIP) model (June‚Äì August, 2020)**
‚Ä¢ Worked on channel estimation in a MIMO communication system at a lower complexity compared to MMSE.
‚Ä¢ Implemented and analyzed the DIP model with multiple architectures, including deep decoder and encoder-decoder. Extended
this setup for a novel application on mmWave MIMO.
‚Ä¢ Supervised by Kameswara Kocharlakota (M.Sc) Prof. Sergey Vorobyov, Aalto University, Finland.
‚Ä¢ **_Technology used:_** PyTorch, Python, MATLAB, Git, Linux.

**Language modeling of Indian Languages (October ‚Äì December 2019)**
‚Ä¢ Worked on language modelling for Gujarati, Tamil and Telugu using N-grams and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN).
‚Ä¢ Supervised by Dr. Mittul Singh and Prof. Mikko Kurimo, Aalto University, Finland.
‚Ä¢ Toolkits used: VariKn (for N-gram), TheanoLM (for RNN).



**Content based filtering for OSN online social networking (Bachelor‚Äôs thesis)**
‚Ä¢ Created a Java based NLP application that enables users to blacklist keywords from being posted on their timelines on social media.
Audio, video and text content filtering were implemented.
‚Ä¢ Supervised by Prof. Annie Julie Joseph, Model Engineering College, India
‚Ä¢ Software used: Java, JavaScript , VisualBasic ,HTML/CSS
